# shopping_list
##An application to create and maintain shopping lists

I'm lazy (that's why I'm a programmer). I get tired of writing down shopping list for the grocery store.
I shop for 75% of the same stuff each week. I should just have a base list that I can use over and over again with the ability to tweak
the list for the one off items that I need. I could certainly do this in google sheets or some other spreadsheet but I don't want to 
print it out. I could use one of the many shopping list applications on the web but I want features that they don't have. So I'm going to write my 
own.

###features
* create accounts
* create/store lists
  * named
  * frequently used
* add attributes to items on the list (eg. bread - whole wheat)
* add categories to items on the list (eg. dairy section)
* ability to add "frequency" to items to prompt for suggestions (advanced feature) 
* ability to divide the items on the list amongst collaborators
  * by category, other
* share lists with other folks
  * Invite by email
* Phoenix channels so that my wife and I can divide and conquer and don't get the same stuff 
* React native mobile app (future feature)
* Other stuff
